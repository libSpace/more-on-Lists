# Control Flow in Python

Control flow in Python refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. Key control flow structures include conditional statements and loops. Here's an overview with code snippets focusing on key points:

1. **Conditional Statements:**
   - **if Statement:**
     ```python
     age = 20
     if age >= 18:
         print("You are an adult.")
     else:
         print("You are a minor.")
     ```
   - **elif Statement:**
     ```python
     score = 75
     if score >= 90:
         print("Excellent!")
     elif score >= 70:
         print("Good job!")
     else:
         print("Work harder.")
     ```

2. **Loops:**
   - **for Loop:**
     ```python
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     for num in numbers:
         print(num)
     ```
   - **while Loop:**
     ```python
     count = 0
     while count < 5:
         print(count)
         count += 1
     ```

3. **Break and Continue:**
   - **break Statement:**
     ```python
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     for num in numbers:
         if num == 4:
             break
         print(num)
     ```
   - **continue Statement:**
     ```python
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     for num in numbers:
         if num == 3:
             continue
         print(num)
     ```

4. **Try and Except (Exception Handling):**
   ```python
   try:
       result = 10 / 0
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Cannot divide by zero.")
   else:
       print(result)
   finally:
       print("Execution complete.")
   ```

5. **Ternary Operator:**
   ```python
   age = 20
   status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
   print(status)
   ```

These control flow structures enables the creation of dynamic and responsive programs in Python, allowing developers to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions and iterate through sequences efficiently.

## Python Functions

1. **Function Definition:**
   - Declare a function using the `def` keyword.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         print(f"Hello, {name}!")
     ```

2. **Function Call:**
   - Call a function by using its name followed by parentheses.
   - Example:
     ```python
     greet("Alice")
     ```

3. **Parameters and Arguments:**
   - Functions can take parameters (inputs).
   - Example:
     ```python
     def add_numbers(a, b):
         return a + b
     result = add_numbers(3, 5)
     ```

4. **Default Parameters:**
   - Assign default values to parameters.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
         print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")
     ```

5. **Return Statement:**
   - Use `return` to send a value back from a function.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def square(num):
         return num ** 2
     ```

6. **Multiple Returns:**
   - Functions can return multiple values.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def calculate(a, b):
         sum_result = a + b
         product_result = a * b
         return sum_result, product_result
     ```

7. **Lambda Functions:**
   - Create small, anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword.
   - Example:
     ```python
     multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
     ```

8. **Recursion:**
   - Functions can call themselves.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def factorial(n):
         if n == 0 or n == 1:
             return 1
         else:
             return n * factorial(n - 1)
     ```

9. **Global and Local Variables:**
   - Variables inside a function have local scope by default.
   - Example:
     ```python
     global_var = 10

     def print_vars():
         local_var = 5
         print(global_var, local_var)
     ```

10. **Docstrings:**
    - Document functions using docstrings for clarity.
    - Example:
      ```python
      def power(base, exponent):
          """
          Calculate the power of a number.
          :param base: Base number
          :param exponent: Exponent
          :return: Result of the power operation
          """
          return base ** exponent
      ```
These aspects of Python functions allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and well-documented code.

## Introduction to Modules
In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. These files can define functions, variables, and classes, and can also include runnable code. The primary purpose of modules is to organize code into reusable and logically structured units. By using modules, developers can break down a large program into smaller, more manageable parts, making the codebase more modular and maintainable. Modules provide a way to encapsulate related functionality, avoid naming conflicts, and facilitate code reuse across different parts of a program or even in other projects. Modules are a fundamental concept in Python's modular programming approach, promoting clarity, organization, and collaboration in software development.

1. **Module Creation:**
   - Create a module by saving a Python script (`.py` file) with functions, variables, or classes.
   - Example: Save the following in a file named `math_operations.py`
     ```python
     def add(a, b):
         return a + b

     def subtract(a, b):
         return a - b
     ```

2. **Module Import:**
   - Import a module using the `import` keyword.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import math_operations

     result = math_operations.add(5, 3)
     ```

3. **Alias for Modules:**
   - Use `as` to create an alias for a module.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import math_operations as math_ops

     result = math_ops.subtract(8, 4)
     ```

4. **Import Specific Items:**
   - Import only specific functions or variables from a module.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from math_operations import add

     result = add(3, 7)
     ```

5. **Module Documentation:**
   - Document modules using docstrings for clarity.
   - Example: Add docstring to `math_operations.py`
     ```python
     """
     A module for basic math operations.
     """

     def add(a, b):
         """
         Add two numbers.
         """
         return a + b

     def subtract(a, b):
         """
         Subtract one number from another.
         """
         return a - b
     ```

6. **Built-in Modules:**
   - Python comes with built-in modules for various functionalities.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import random

     random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
     ```

7. **Package:**
   - A package is a collection of Python modules organized in a directory.
   - Example:
     ```
     my_package/
       __init__.py
       module1.py
       module2.py
     ```
     ```python
     # __init__.py can be an empty file or can include initialization code for the package
     ```
Modules in Python allows for better code organization, reusability, and the ability to leverage external functionality through imports.

## Regular Expressions

In Python, regular expressions, often denoted as regex, serve as a robust mechanism for pattern matching and string manipulation. Leveraging the `re` module, these expressions allow developers to define intricate search patterns, enabling tasks such as locating specific sequences of characters, validating data formats, and extracting information from strings. Regular expressions consist of a combination of special characters and symbols that form rules for matching patterns, providing a concise and powerful means for text processing. Whether validating user input, parsing data, or searching for specific substrings, regular expressions enhance Python's capabilities in handling and manipulating textual data.

1. **Importing the `re` Module:**
   - Import the `re` module to work with regular expressions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import re
     ```

2. **Basic Patterns:**
   - Regular expressions consist of patterns that define search criteria.
   - Example:
     ```python
     pattern = r"\d+"  # Match one or more digits
     ```

3. **Search Function:**
   - Use `re.search()` to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a string.
   - Example:
     ```python
     text = "The price is $25.99."
     match = re.search(r"\$\d+\.\d{2}", text)
     ```

4. **Match Function:**
   - Use `re.match()` to match the pattern at the beginning of a string.
   - Example:
     ```python
     result = re.match(r"He", "Hello, Python!")
     ```

5. **Findall Function:**
   - Use `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
   - Example:
     ```python
     numbers = re.findall(r"\d+", "There are 10 apples and 5 oranges.")
     ```

6. **Compile Function:**
   - Use `re.compile()` to pre-compile a regex pattern for reuse.
   - Example:
     ```python
     pattern = re.compile(r"\b\w{3}\b")  # Match three-letter words
     ```

7. **Grouping:**
   - Use parentheses to group parts of a pattern.
   - Example:
     ```python
     match = re.search(r"(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)", "Date: 2023-11-09")
     ```

8. **Quantifiers:**
   - Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group.
   - Example:
     ```python
     pattern = r"\d{2,4}"  # Match 2 to 4 digits
     ```

9. **Character Classes:**
   - Use square brackets to define character classes.
   - Example:
     ```python
     vowels = re.findall(r"[aeiou]", "Hello, Python!")
     ```

10. **Anchors:**
    - Anchors specify the position of a match in a string.
    - Example:
      ```python
      result = re.match(r"^Hello", "Hello, Python!")
      ```

Regular expressions in Python provide a powerful tool for string manipulation, text parsing, and pattern matching. Understanding and using regex can greatly enhance text processing capabilities in Python programs.

# Data Structures
 data structures in Python include:

Python provides a variety of built-in data structures that can be used to organize and manipulate data efficiently. Some of the key data structures in Python include:

1. **Lists:**
   - Ordered, mutable sequences.
   - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']`

2. **Tuples:**
   - Ordered, immutable sequences.
   - Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')`

3. **Sets:**
   - Unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b'}`

4. **Dictionaries:**
   - Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
   - Example: `my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`

5. **Strings:**
   - Ordered, immutable sequences of characters.
   - Example: `my_string = "Hello, World!"`

6. **Arrays (from the array module):**
   - Homogeneous, fixed-size sequences.
   - Example: `import array; my_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])` (here, 'i' represents integer type)

7. **Queues (from the queue module):**
   - Implements the queue data structure.
   - Example: `from queue import Queue; my_queue = Queue()`

8. **Stacks:**
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) structures.
   - Can be implemented using lists or the `collections.deque` class.

9. **Heaps (from the heapq module):**
   - Implements the heap queue algorithm.
   - Example: `import heapq; my_heap = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]; heapq.heapify(my_heap)`

10. **Linked Lists:**
   - Not a built-in type, but can be implemented using custom classes.
   - Consists of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

11. **Deques (from the collections module):**
   - Double-ended queues that support fast O(1) appends and pops from both ends.
   - Example: `from collections import deque; my_deque = deque([1, 2, 3])`

These data structures serve different purposes, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements of your program. Python's built-in data structures, along with the extensive standard library, provide a powerful foundation for working with data in a variety of applications.

## Inheritance and Private Variables

Inheritance:

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (base class or parent class). This relationship enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of code.
 
Here's a basic example in Python:
 
python

Copy code

class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name):

        self.name = name
 
    def speak(self):

        pass  # Placeholder for the speak method
 
 
class Dog(Animal):

    def speak(self):

        return "Woof!"
 
 
class Cat(Animal):

    def speak(self):

        return "Meow!"

In this example, Dog and Cat are subclasses of the Animal class. They inherit the name attribute and have their own implementation of the speak method. This allows you to create instances of Dog and Cat and call the speak method on them.
 
Multiple Inheritance:

Multiple inheritance is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. This means a derived class can have characteristics of multiple parent classes.
 
Here's a simple example in Python:
 
python

Copy code

class A:

    def method_a(self):

        print("Method A from class A")
 
 
class B:

    def method_b(self):

        print("Method B from class B")
 
 
class C(A, B):

    pass  # Inherits from both class A and class B

In this example, class C inherits from both classes A and B. It can access methods from both A and B, allowing for a combination of behaviors.
 
Private Variables:

Private variables are variables that are not directly accessible outside the class they are defined in. They are used to encapsulate the internal state of an object and are prefixed with a double underscore in Python (e.g., __variable).
 
Here's an example:
 
python

Copy code

class MyClass:

    def __init__(self):

        self.__private_variable = 42
 
    def get_private_variable(self):

        return self.__private_variable
 
    def set_private_variable(self, value):

        self.__private_variable = value
 
 
obj = MyClass()

print(obj.get_private_variable())  # Accessing private variable using a getter method

obj.set_private_variable(100)       # Modifying private variable using a setter method

print(obj.get_private_variable())

In this example, __private_variable is a private variable, and you access it through getter and setter methods (get_private_variable and set_private_variable). This encapsulation helps in controlling access to the internal state of the object and prevents direct modification from outside the class.
 
## Iterators, Generators, and more
 
### Iterators:
 
An iterator in Python is an object that can be iterated (looped) over. It implements the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()` or uses the `iter()` and `next()` functions. Iterators are commonly used to iterate through elements in a sequence (like a list or a tuple) or to represent a stream of data.
 
Example using a simple iterator:
 
```python

class MyIterator:

    def __init__(self, data):

        self.data = data

        self.index = 0
 
    def __iter__(self):

        return self
 
    def __next__(self):

        if self.index < len(self.data):

            result = self.data[self.index]

            self.index += 1

            return result

        else:

            raise StopIteration
 
# Using the iterator

my_iter = MyIterator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

for num in my_iter:

    print(num)

```
 
### Generators:
 
Generators are a special kind of iterator. They allow you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without generating the entire sequence in memory at once. Generators are created using a function with the `yield` keyword.
 
Example of a generator:
 
```python

def my_generator():

    yield 1

    yield 2

    yield 3

    yield 4

    yield 5
 
# Using the generator

gen = my_generator()

for num in gen:

    print(num)

```
 
### Generator Expressions:
 
Generator expressions are a concise way to create generators. They have a syntax similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets.
 
Example of a generator expression:
 
```python

gen = (x for x in range(1, 6))

for num in gen:

    print(num)

```
 
### Operating System Interface:
 
The `os` module in Python provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality, such as reading or writing to the file system, interacting with the underlying operating system, etc.
 
Example of using the `os` module:
 
```python

import os
 
current_directory = os.getcwd()

print(f"Current Directory: {current_directory}")

```
 
### Command Line Arguments:
 
The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. The `sys.argv` list contains command-line arguments passed to a Python script.
 
Example of using command line arguments:
 
```python

import sys
 
script_name = sys.argv[0]

arguments = sys.argv[1:]
 
print(f"Script Name: {script_name}")

print(f"Arguments: {arguments}")

```
 
### Error Output Redirection and Program Termination:
 
The `sys` module can also be used to redirect standard output and standard error streams, and the `sys.exit()` function can be used to terminate a program.
 
Example of redirecting error output:
 
```python

import sys
 
sys.stderr.write("This is an error message.\n")

```
 
### String Pattern Matching:
 
The `re` module in Python provides regular expression matching operations, allowing you to work with patterns in strings.
 
Example of string pattern matching:
 
```python

import re
 
pattern = r"\b\w+oo\w+\b"

text = "Python is cool and foo bar is too."
 
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)

```
 
### Internet Access:
 
For internet access, Python provides several modules, such as `urllib` and `requests`, to interact with the web by making HTTP requests.
 
Example using the `requests` module:
 
```python

import requests
 
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")

print(response.text)

```
 
These examples provide a brief overview of each topic. Depending on your needs, you may need to explore these concepts further for a more in-depth understanding.

        self.data = data

        self.index = 0
 
    def __iter__(self):

        return self
 
    def __next__(self):

        if self.index < len(self.data):

            result = self.data[self.index]

            self.index += 1

            return result

        else:

            raise StopIteration
 
# Using the iterator

my_iter = MyIterator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

for num in my_iter:

    print(num)

```
 
### Generators:
 
Generators are a special kind of iterator. They allow you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without generating the entire sequence in memory at once. Generators are created using a function with the `yield` keyword.
 
Example of a generator:
 
```python

def my_generator():

    yield 1

    yield 2

    yield 3

    yield 4

    yield 5
 
# Using the generator

gen = my_generator()

for num in gen:

    print(num)

```
 
### Generator Expressions:
 
Generator expressions are a concise way to create generators. They have a syntax similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets.
 
Example of a generator expression:
 
```python

gen = (x for x in range(1, 6))

for num in gen:

    print(num)

```
 
### Operating System Interface:
 
The `os` module in Python provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality, such as reading or writing to the file system, interacting with the underlying operating system, etc.
 
Example of using the `os` module:
 
```python

import os
 
current_directory = os.getcwd()

print(f"Current Directory: {current_directory}")

```
 
### Command Line Arguments:
 
The `sys` module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. The `sys.argv` list contains command-line arguments passed to a Python script.
 
Example of using command line arguments:
 
```python

import sys
 
script_name = sys.argv[0]

arguments = sys.argv[1:]
 
print(f"Script Name: {script_name}")

print(f"Arguments: {arguments}")

```
 
### Error Output Redirection and Program Termination:
 
The `sys` module can also be used to redirect standard output and standard error streams, and the `sys.exit()` function can be used to terminate a program.
 
Example of redirecting error output:
 
```python

import sys
 
sys.stderr.write("This is an error message.\n")

```
 
### String Pattern Matching:
 
The `re` module in Python provides regular expression matching operations, allowing you to work with patterns in strings.
 
Example of string pattern matching:
 
```python

import re
 
pattern = r"\b\w+oo\w+\b"

text = "Python is cool and foo bar is too."
 
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)

```
 
### Internet Access:
 
For internet access, Python provides several modules, such as `urllib` and `requests`, to interact with the web by making HTTP requests.
 
Example using the `requests` module:
 
```python

import requests
 
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")

print(response.text)

```

## Dates and Times, Data Compression and Output Formatting

### Dates and Times:
 
In Python, the `datetime` module is commonly used for working with dates and times. It provides classes for representing dates, times, and intervals.
 
Example of working with dates and times:
 
```python

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
 
# Current date and time

now = datetime.now()

print("Current Date and Time:", now)
 
# Formatting date

formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

print("Formatted Date:", formatted_date)
 
# Adding 2 days to the current date

two_days_later = now + timedelta(days=2)

print("Two days later:", two_days_later)

```
 
### Data Compression:
 
Python provides the `gzip` and `zipfile` modules for working with compressed files.
 
Example of using gzip:
 
```python

import gzip
 
with open('example.txt', 'rb') as f_in:

    with gzip.open('example.txt.gz', 'wb') as f_out:

        f_out.writelines(f_in)

```
 
### Performance Measurement:
 
The `timeit` module is useful for measuring the execution time of small bits of Python code.
 
Example of measuring performance:
 
```python

import timeit
 
code_to_measure = """

result = 0

for i in range(1000):

    result += i

"""
 
time_taken = timeit.timeit(code_to_measure, number=10000)

print("Time taken:", time_taken)

```
 
### Quality Control:
 
For quality control, Python offers various tools and libraries. `unittest` is a built-in library for writing and running tests, and external tools like `pytest` provide additional features.
 
Example using `unittest`:
 
```python

import unittest
 
def add(x, y):

    return x + y
 
class TestAddition(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):

        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
 
if __name__ == '__main__':

    unittest.main()

```
 
### Output Formatting:
 
The `format()` method and f-strings are commonly used for formatting output in Python.
 
Example using `format()`:
 
```python

name = "John"

age = 30

formatted_output = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)

print(formatted_output)

```
 
### Templating:
 
For more advanced output formatting, especially in web development, you can use template engines like Jinja2 or Django templates.
 
Example using Jinja2:
 
```python

from jinja2 import Template
 
template_string = "Hello, {{ name }}!"

template = Template(template_string)

output = template.render(name="John")

print(output)

```
 
These examples provide a starting point for each topic. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to explore these concepts further for more complex scenarios or specialized requirements.
 
## Logging, Managing packages with pip, and Floating point Arithmetic

### Logging:
 
Logging is a built-in module in Python that provides flexible logging of messages for debugging and informational purposes. It allows you to capture and store log messages at different levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
 
Example of basic logging configuration:
 
```python

import logging
 
# Configure the logging module

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
 
# Usage of logging

logging.debug("This is a debug message")

logging.info("This is an info message")

logging.warning("This is a warning message")

logging.error("This is an error message")

logging.critical("This is a critical message")

```
 
### Virtual Environments:
 
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to install and manage packages independently of the system-wide Python installation. This is useful for managing dependencies for different projects.
 
### Creating Virtual Environments:
 
```bash

# Using venv (available in Python 3.3 and later)

python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment

source myenv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS

myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

```
 
### Managing Packages with pip:
 
`pip` is the package installer for Python, and it is used to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages.
 
Example of using `pip`:
 
```bash

# Install a package

pip install package_name
 
# Install a specific version of a package

pip install package_name==1.2.3
 
# Install packages from a requirements file

pip install -r requirements.txt
 
# Show installed packages

pip list

```
 
### Floating Point Arithmetic:
 
Floating-point arithmetic in computers can sometimes result in precision issues due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. Python's `decimal` module provides a `Decimal` data type with a user-settable precision to avoid some of these issues.
 
Example using the `decimal` module:
 
```python

from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
 
# Set the precision

getcontext().prec = 6
 
# Perform decimal arithmetic

result = Decimal('1') / Decimal('7')

print(result)

```
 
It's essential to be aware of floating-point precision limitations and consider using `decimal` for applications where precision is crucial, such as financial calculations.
